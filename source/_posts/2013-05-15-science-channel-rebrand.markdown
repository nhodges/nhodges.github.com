I'm thoroughly impressed by The Science Channels ~~rebranding~~ rebirth, which has underscored by Morph, the brainchild of creative studio [Imaginary Forces](http://www.imaginaryforces.com "Imaginary Forces"). Instead of a the customary, static television logo that has been the norm, Morph evolves and changes to match the theme of multiple programming genres, while systematically maintaining cohesive, recognizable branding.
