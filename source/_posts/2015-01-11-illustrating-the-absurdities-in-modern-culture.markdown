When I first happened upon Luis Quiles, I was blown away and quite surprised I had not seen his work before. [Luis' illustrations](http://gunsmithcat.deviantart.com/) tackle many social issues often considered a byproduct of the status quo, raising convtroversial questions about prescription medication abuse, censorship, sexism, violence, and perhaps the most perverse of them all, our culture's fixation on mass and social media. If you love his work, follow him on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/78muse) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/luisquilesart).
